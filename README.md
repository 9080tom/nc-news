# NC News front-end web app

[Try the app hosted on Netlify]

This is my version of a front-end for Northcoders News. It is powered by my back-end hosted on Heroku

Northcoders News is a social news website. Styled to work in a similar way to Reddit.

Northcoders News has articles which are created by users and divided into topics. Each article has a vote count and can be up or down voted by a user. Users can also add comments about an article. Comments can also be up or down voted. A user can also remove any comments or articles which they have added.
